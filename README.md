# Disease-Prediction-using-ML

Aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses.

Checks the accuracy using 4 ML algorithms and based on high accuracy,it shows the diseases predicted by that high accuracy ML:
1] K-Fold cross validation
2] Support Vector Classifier
3] Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
4] Random Forest Classifier
